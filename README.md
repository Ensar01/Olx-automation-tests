# Olx-automation-tests

Some tests I wrote for a university project using Selenium WebDriver and Mocha. These tests automate UI interactions on OLX.ba, covering basic functionalities such as searching for products and user registration. The setup includes ChromeDriver, and test execution is handled via Mocha with built-in Node.js assertions.

A separate setup and teardown file is used globally to initialize and clean up WebDriver instances before and after each test, ensuring test isolation and reliability.
